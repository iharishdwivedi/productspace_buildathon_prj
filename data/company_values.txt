CORE COMPANY VALUES AND BEHAVIORS

Value 1: Customer Obsession
- Start with the customer's needs and work backward
- Build products that solve real, validated user problems
- Strive to earn and maintain customer trust in every interaction
- Use customer feedback (both good and bad) to drive innovation

Value 2: Think Big & Innovate
- Don't be constrained by "how it's always been done"
- Propose bold ideas, even if they seem unconventional
- Take calculated risks and learn from failures
- Dedicate time to "deep work" and creative thinking (e.g., "Innovation Fridays")

Value 3: Ownership & Accountability
- Act like an owner; never say, "That's not my job"
- Take responsibility for your work from start to finish
- If you see a problem, you own it until it's resolved (or escalated correctly)
- Be accountable for your results, not just your effort

Value 4: Bias for Action
- Speed matters; value calculated execution over perfect, slow planning
- Make "two-way door" decisions quickly; escalate "one-way door" decisions
- It's better to act and ask for forgiveness than to wait for consensus
- Prioritize tasks based on impact and deliver results

Value 5: Deliver Results
- Focus on the key inputs that drive the desired business outcomes
- Rise to the occasion and deliver high-quality work on time
- Don't let "perfect" be the enemy of "good" and "shipped"
- Overcome obstacles and find solutions, not excuses

Value 6: One Team
- Respect and value diverse perspectives
- Assume positive intent in your colleagues
- Be transparent, candid, and respectful in your communication
- Commit to decisions as a team, even if you disagreed during the debate
